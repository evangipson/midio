## Coding conventions
- We indent using 4 spaces
- We put spaces after any list or function parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), and around operators (x += 1, not x+=1)
- We use camelCase for functions, variables, and just about everything else except UPPERCASE for global variables
- We use Visual Studio Code, as mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/evangipson/midio/blob/master/README.md#built-with)
- We use [Visual Studio Code JSDoc commenting style](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt162307.aspx) on anything more complex than a variable.
